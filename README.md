DeltaCamera
===========

This app uses the camera to record movement (thus "delta") and visualize it in one picture.
For example running ants leave dark lines on a light surface, or driving cars or a torch make 
light lines on a dark surface. Make sure not to move the camera during recording or use a tripod.
You can share images, adjust sensitivity and switch between light-on-dark and dark-on-light mode.

Based on Android's Camera2 API sample, using RenderScript. Actually this is a how-to-use-renderscript
demo.
